Solana (Rust) Education

⸻

What This Repository Is

This repository contains draft standards, quality frameworks, and pedagogical principles being developed by STAR Network to support the professionalization of Solana (Rust) education.

The materials here document:
1. How educator quality can be evaluated responsibly
2. How technical and pedagogical competence can be described
3. How shared expectations may emerge over time

All content in this repository reflects work in progress and is published to make the thinking behind STAR Network’s approach transparent.

⸻

What This Repository Is Not

This repository is not:
1. A finalized or authoritative standards body
2. A certification or accreditation system
3. A regulatory or enforcement mechanism
4. A training course or curriculum
5. An open community contribution project (at this stage)

Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as a mandate, requirement, or formal standard.

Current Status
**Status: In Development (Draft / v0.x)**
1. Frameworks are exploratory and evolving
2. Language is descriptive, not prescriptive
3. Content will change based on observed practice, pilots, and governance decisions

Formal standards, certification programs, and benchmarking mechanisms — if and when introduced — will be published only after sufficient maturity and review.

How This Repository Relates to STAR Network

This repository is part of STAR Network, an independent professional association initiative focused on building trust, verification frameworks, and emerging standards for Solana (Rust) education.

Within the STAR Network ecosystem:
1. This repository captures standards and framework development
2. The registry documents real educator experience
3. Train-the-Trainer and benchmarking programs are developed in parallel and informed by these frameworks

This separation ensures that standards emerge from evidence and practice, rather than being declared upfront.
