# Contributing to the STAR Network Standards Framework

Thank you for your interest in STAR Network.

This repository contains **draft standards, quality frameworks, and pedagogical principles** related to **Solana (Rust) education**.  
These materials are part of an **in-development standards effort** and are published to make the underlying thinking transparent.

At this stage, contributions are handled deliberately and conservatively.

---

## Current Contribution Mode

**Phase: Guided Feedback (Issues Only)**

This repository is **not open for general pull requests**.

At this stage:
- Pull requests are **not accepted**
- Contributions are **not merged by default**
- Feedback is gathered to inform internal iteration and governance design

This approach helps preserve neutrality, coherence, and long-term trust as standards mature.

---

## What Kind of Input Is Welcome

We welcome **thoughtful, structured feedback** on:

- Clarity of concepts or language
- Gaps or ambiguities in draft frameworks
- Pedagogical observations relevant to Solana (Rust) education
- Questions that help surface assumptions or edge cases

All feedback should be submitted via **GitHub Issues**.

---

## How to Submit Feedback

When opening an issue, please:

1. Reference the specific document and section  
2. Describe the concern or observation clearly  
3. Focus on explanation, not advocacy  
4. Avoid assuming authority, enforcement, or finality  

Issues that are promotional, repetitive, or out of scope may be closed without response.

---

## What Is Not Open for Contribution (Yet)

Please do **not** submit:

- Pull requests proposing new standards or rules
- Certification criteria, scoring systems, or thresholds
- Enforcement mechanisms or compliance language
- Commercial proposals, partnerships, or endorsements
- Requests for registry inclusion or certification via issues

These areas require governance maturity and separate processes.

---

## Governance & Neutrality

STAR Network operates as a **neutral professional association initiative**.

To preserve trust:
- Decisions are not made by popularity or volume of input
- Feedback does not imply acceptance or rejection
- Silence should not be interpreted as outcome

Formal governance and participation models will be published as the project evolves.

---

## Future Contribution Pathways

Structured participation — including working groups, reviews, or formal contributions — may be introduced after:

- Standards frameworks reach stability
- Train-the-Trainer programs mature
- Benchmarking approaches are clearly defined

When this happens, contribution guidelines will be updated transparently.

## Guiding Principle

> **Standards require restraint before participation.  
> Trust requires process before openness.**

Thank you for respecting the stage and intent of this work.
